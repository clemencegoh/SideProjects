# AR & VR: Use cases and the future

## VR 
* Early life of VR: *Cave VR*
    * 6 sided cave, makes use of projectors and screens with an enclosed environment for immersive VR
* Current use cases:
    * **Architectural design**
        * Expanding information from sonar scans into 3D levels
            * Oil exploration
            * Oil Rig Design
            * Oil Well planning
    * **Automotive design**
        * Speed up design process and modelling
    * **Aerospace design**
        * Internal and external parts
        * Hardware design in 1:1 scale
    * **Pharmaceutical and Molecular Chemistry**
        * Need to move molecules around in 3D to visualize placement 
        * Visualize DNA
    * **Research**
        * Medical research for bio after CAT scan
        * Replaying data such as *formation of tornadoes*
        * *Re-imagining* and walking through ancient ruins
        * Visualizing real spaces such as supermarkets for placement of products
    * **Real Estate**
        * Walk through homes before they're built
        * Interior design
    * **Military**
        * Simulations
    * **Data visualization**
        * Visualize in 3D
            * Useful for anti-money laundering
            * Useful for connections and relationships
            * *NOTE* that this will not be useful for AI since commonly we use more than 3 dimensions
* How do we create an *immersive* experience?
    * Input into the human sense
    * **SIGHT**
        * images fed into both eyes must not be the same (time, positioning)
        * Called Active refresh rate glasses
        * *Currently* uses goggles to replace screens
            * Problem: Does not give full immersive experience
                * Should be solved by increasing the angle in which screen covers
    * **SOUND**
        * *Surround sound technology*
        * *Interactive Resonance Audio*
            * Echos 
            * Noise cancellation
    * **TOUCH**
        * Haptic technology
        * *Current tech limited to wearing suits*
        * **MOTION**
            * Currently unavailable
            * Can only be replicated with tech to change acceleration
    * **SMELL**
        * Attachment to goggles, no real product yet
    * **TASTE**
        * Prototype, no real product yet

## Redefining inputs to computer by humans
* Motion detection
    * 1st gen: ultrasonic/infrared
    * 2nd gen: cameras/kinect
        * LEAP motion detector <= had this in SUTD
            * Detects hand motions only
    * 3rd gen: Accelerometer + Gyroscope
        * detects motion and sends data into computer
* Facial expressions
* Direct brain command
    * NextMind
        * Non-invasive: picks up commands from cortex

## AR & MR (Merged reality)
* Merged reality edits the real world directly
* AR strictly super-imposes onto real world
* Driven by **LCD**
    * Flat panel display using Liquid Crystal Display and Organic LED
* **Presents new problem**:
    * Need to know and understand environment
        * OpenCV
        * ARCore
        * ARKit
* Use cases
    * Shopping (Retail experience)
        * Show prices as AR instead of placing labels everywhere
    * Navigation
    * Maintenance & repair with Remote assistance
        * Comes in handy with aging population no longer wanting to be out on the field since they are unable to physically
        * Younger population will be able to do tasks with older assistant
    * Remote meetings
    * Facial Recognition
        * To remember people
    * Banking Environment - AR trading POC (???)

## Holograms
* Need lasers
    * Basic concept: Interference pattern
* Used for security stickers
    * 3D image on 2D piece of paper
    * Mostly optical illusion
* Project 3D on screens at a 45 degree angle
* Pyramid on phone to give an illusion of hologram
* Next step: *Interactive Holograms*
* > **Femtosecond laser plasma** <
    * Using lasers to ionize air to produce light
